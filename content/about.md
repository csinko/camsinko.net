![Hotwheels Computer](/hotwheels-computer.png#center)


I've been fascinated with computers for as long as I can remember.  what started with basic VB scripts has evolved to writing low-level embedded C code. I've come to learn that I simply love designing with quality tools, and computers are the most powerful tools of today.  I especially like writing software for electronics, networking, and hands-on projects.

Born in Akron, Ohio in 1997, i'm one of the oldest of Gen Z and grew up in The Rust Belt.  I grew up with the internet and social media, which is a first in our world.  For someone that likes to explore, the world at your fingertips was extremely powerful for a young mind.  The Rust Belt is filled with dilapidated infrastructure, abandonment, and corruption, but the internet made it easy to learn anything I wanted.  Unfortunately for me, my skillset outgrew my homeland's dated ecosystem.

After COVID-19 and a 1-year stint in Silicon Valley, I fear that Silicon Valley has peaked and is beginning down the same path that led to the demise of Motor City.  I now live in Orange County, California and work as a software engineer at Anduril.
