It was a week after the George Floyd incident, America was in the most turmoil that I had seen, and I called an audible. I took out my life savings in a cashiers check, got in my car, and started driving. My only housing prospect was with a guy I emailed on Craigslist who wanted to meet in person, and I had nothing better to do during the Pandemic.</description></item><item><title>A Year in Isolation</title><link>https://camsinko.net/posts/a-year-in-isolation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 14:20:41 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://camsinko.net/posts/a-year-in-isolation/</guid><description>The Path Not Taken While most of the world opted to stay at home during The Pandemic, I ended up moving across the country from Ohio, a state that was relatively lax with restrictions, to California, by far the most restrictive state. I knew this meant I would be spending a lot of time alone, but the effects of isolation were far more powerful than I had realized.

My home town of Akron, Ohio became the epicenter for tire production, a critical wear-item for cars. Akron quickly became a boomtown, exploding in population 5x from about 40 thousand in 1900 to over 200 thousand by 1920.

The weather, traffic, politics, etc. Rather than let these bother me, I aim to focus on the things I can control.

Your soul&amp;rsquo;s worth about as much as you can get on Wall Street, my dear

I&amp;rsquo;ve come to learn that I simply love designing with quality tools, and computers are the most powerful tools of today. I especially like writing software for electronics, networking, and hands-on projects.
Born in Akron, Ohio in 1997, i&amp;rsquo;m one of the oldest of Gen Z and grew up in The Rust Belt.</description></item><item><title>Stuff</title><link>https://camsinko.net/stuff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://camsinko.net/stuff/</guid><description>Hardware Laptop: MacBook Air M1 in Rose Gold. Why Rose Gold? Because gold is bold, like that sweet, sweet M1. The M1 is insanely fast and power efficient.
Phone: iPhone 12 Pro Max. Was rocking Android for years, but don&amp;rsquo;t got time to be messing around with ROMs anymore. The beauty of the Apple ecosystem, it just works. I chose the 12 Pro Max to circumvent the need to buy a nice camera.</description></item></channel></rss>
